% WORK IN PROGRESS - MAY NEED THE OTHER VIEW IN DLC TO FIND THE PELLET...

% 0 ? No pellet, mechanical failure
% 1 -  First trial success (obtained pellet on initial limb advance)
% 2 -  Success (obtain pellet, but not on first attempt)
% 3 -  Forelimb advance -pellet dropped in box
% 4 -  Forelimb advance -pellet knocked off shelf
% 5 -  Obtain pellet with tongue
% 6 -  Walk away without forelimb advance, no forelimb advance
% 7 -  Reached, pellet remains on shelf
% 8 - Used only contralateral paw
% 9 - Laser fired at the wrong time
% 10 ?Used preferred paw after obtaining or moving pellet with tongue
% 11 - paw started out through the slot
