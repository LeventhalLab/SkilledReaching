function sessionSummary = sessionKinematicsSummary(reachData)

% calculate the following kinematic parameters:
% 1. max velocity, by reach type
% 2. average trajectory for a session, by reach time
% 3. deviation from that trajectory for a session
% 4. distance between trajectories
% 5. closest distance paw to pellet
% 6. minimum z, by type
% 7. number of reaches, by type
