%
% INPUTS:
%   pawTrajectory - numFrames x 3 x numBodyparts array. Each numFramex x 3
%       matrix contains x,y,z points for each bodypart

%   direct_pts, mirror_pts - num_bodyparts x num_frames x 2 matrices
%       containing (x,y) coordinates of each bodypart in each frame
%   direct_p, mirror_p - number of body parts x number of frames array
%       containing p-values for how confident DLC is that a body part was
%       correctly identified
%   direct_bp, mirror_bp - 
%   bodyparts - cell array containing strings describing each bodypart in
%       the same order as in the pawTrajectory array
%   isPointValid - 2-element cell array containing boolean vectors 
%       indicating whether each body part was deemed a valid point (true = 
%       valid). 1st array is for direct view, second array for mirror
%       view
%   boxCal - box calibration structure with the following fields:
%       .E - essential matrix (3 x 3 x numViews) array where numViews is
%           the number of different mirror views (3 for now)
%       .F - fundamental matrix (3 x 3 x numViews) array where numViews is
%           the number of different mirror views (3 for now)
%       .Pn - camera matrices assuming the direct view is eye(4,3). 4 x 3 x
%           numViews array
%       .P - direct camera matrix (eye(4,3))
%       .cameraParams
%       .curDate - YYYYMMDD format date the data were collected
%   pawPref - 
%
% VARARGS:
%   pcutoff - p-value to use as a cutoff for high vs low probability points
