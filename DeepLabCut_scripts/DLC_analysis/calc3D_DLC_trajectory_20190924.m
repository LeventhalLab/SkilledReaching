%
% INPUTS:
%   final_direct_pts, final_mirror_pts - number of body parts x number of frames x 2
%       array containing measured direct and mirror points that have been
%       shifted into their respective ROIs and undistorted
%   direct_p, mirror_p - number of body parts x number of frames array
%       containing p-values for how confident DLC is that a body part was
%       correctly identified
%   direct_bp, mirror_bp - cell arrays containing lists of body parts
%       descriptors
%   boxCal - structure with the following fields:
%       E - 
%       cameraParams - matlab camera parameters structure
%   pawPref - 'right' or 'left'
%   imSize - 2-element vector with frame height x width
%
% OUTPUTS:
%   pawTrajectory - numFrames x 3 x numBodyparts array. Each numFramex x 3
%       matrix contains x,y,z points for each bodypart
%   bodyparts - cell array containing strings describing each bodypart in
%       the same order as in the pawTrajectory array
%   dist_from_epipole - 
%   final_direct_pts
%	final_mirror_pts
%   isEstimate - m x n x 2 array of booleans, where m is the number of
%       bodyparts, n is the number of frames, and the last index indicates
%       whether it's the direct (1) or mirror (2) views. True indicates
%       that this bodypart's position was estimated; false indicates that
%       it was measured directly by DLC

% assume that direct and mirror body part labels are the same

% points_still_distorted = true;   % set to false if vids were undistorted prior to running through deeplabcut
