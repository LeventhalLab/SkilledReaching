% WORKING HERE - WANT TO SET THIS UP SO THAT:
%   1) NO POINTS INCLUDED IN A DIGIT OR PAW DORSUM MASK CAN BE OUTSIDE THE
%   ORIGINAL PAW MASK
%   2) "HIDDEN" POINTS ARE IDENTIFIED BY ASSUMING THAT THE LARGER BOUNDING
%   MASK CONTAINS THE REAL DIGIT 3D COORDINATES (AS LONG AS ITS PROJECTION
%   DOESN'T EXTEND OUTSIDE THE BACKGROUND SUBTRACTED MASKING)
%   3) NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO CONSTRAIN OBJECTS SO THAT THEY DON'T GROW
%   TOO MUCH WHEN I TRY TO FILL OUT THE PROJECTION MASK IN DIRECTIONS THAT
%   AREN'T IMPORTANT (MAYBE 3D RECONSTRUCTION CONSTRAINGS ALL POINTS TO BE
%   WITHIN COME RADIUS OF EACH OTHER?)
%   4) GET AROUND OBSCURATION BY THE BOX BY KNOWING WHERE THAT WILL OCCUR,
%   AND WHEN THE BOUNDING BOX OF THE PAW REACHES THOSE BORDERS, EXTEND THE
%   BBOX THROUGH THAT REGION?
